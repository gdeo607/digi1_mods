# Usage

## Digi Poly (elekloader mod `digipoly`, 1.0c)
1. On any audio track press FUNC+SRC and choose **POLY** (after SLICE). The track keeps its sample, filter, amp
   and LFO settings as with any machine (POLY plays like ONESHOT).
2. **TRIG page**: on a POLY track it is the MIDI tracks' page: **NOT1** (the note), **NOT2-NOT4** (extra notes as
   semitone offsets from NOT1; the centre value = off), **VEL**, **LEN**, **PROB**, **LFO.T**, with the track's
   **LEV** fader beside them as on the other audio pages. Set them for the track, or hold a trig in grid recording
   and turn a knob to lock a step's own chord.
3. **Chords**: every trig plays NOT1 on the track's own voice and each of NOT2-NOT4 on a voice **borrowed** from
   another track. The borrowed voice plays the POLY track's whole sound and gets its own sound back at its own next
   trig. Which voice: the one whose last note started longest ago, never
   - a track you took out of the pool in SETTINGS > POLY,
   - a muted track,
   - a track with a trig at the same moment,
   - a voice holding a live note.
   With no voice left the extra note is skipped. Drum tracks that trig often are therefore borrowed last.
4. **Pressing the track's key** (its trig key, or a key of the FUNC+TRK keyboard) plays the whole chord. Recording
   still records the one note you played; the chord comes back from NOT2-NOT4 on playback.
5. **MIDI in**: notes on the POLY track's own MIDI channel play polyphonically, one voice per note: each note takes
   the track's own voice if it is free, else a borrowed one, and its note-off releases that same voice. No MIDI
   track or cable setup is needed.
6. **SETTINGS > POLY**: which tracks lend their voice to the POLY pool. LEFT/RIGHT choose a track (a bar over it),
   **YES** takes it out of the pool or puts it back. A track in the pool is shown inverted, and the checkbox on the
   left is ticked while the chosen track is in the pool. **This is part of the pattern**: it lives in the pattern's
   kit, so every pattern can lend different voices, and it is saved with the project and comes back after a
   power-off (since 2.0d; earlier builds lost it), like the sound settings around it. Loading a sound onto a
   track does not change it. Patterns that share a kit share the setting. Everything starts in the pool.
7. The POLY track's **LEVEL and every SRC / FLTR / AMP / LFO knob apply to the whole chord**, including voices
   borrowed later, while they are playing its notes.
8. Several tracks can be POLY; each plays its own chords.

## POLY (stand-alone builds and the earlier dt8poly mod)
1. On two or more audio tracks press FUNC+SRC and choose **POLY** (after SLICE). The lowest POLY track is the
   **control** track: its sample, filter and amp settings are used for every voice. Each POLY track keeps its own
   SRC TUNE and LFO.
2. **Sequencer**: trigs on the control track rotate across the POLY tracks.
3. **MIDI cable** (polyphonic playing/sequencing from a MIDI track):
   - Set the POLY tracks' MIDI *receive* channel to one channel, e.g. 13.
   - Set a MIDI track's *output* channel to the same channel. Notes and chords on that MIDI track (step-entered,
     live, or recorded from an external sequencer) now play the POLY tracks, one voice per note (free voice first,
     otherwise the oldest).
   - CCs (< 120) sent by that MIDI track are applied to all POLY tracks on the channel (e.g. filter sequencing).
   - Notes still go out of MIDI OUT as normal.

## Utility page (Scope or Spectrum, chosen at build time)
| key | action |
|---|---|
| "..." (three dots) | open the page (waveform or spectrum) -> X-Y -> close; in the all-views build: waveform -> spectrum -> X-Y -> close |
| YES | fullscreen on/off (main view only, no overlays) |
| NO | close the scope |
| PTN / BANK + trig | change pattern (scope stays open, green LEDs show patterns with data) |
| mutes, page keys, knobs, PLAY/STOP, FUNC combos | work as on the main screen |

- **Top bar**: pattern, name and tempo (hidden in fullscreen).
- **Bottom-right boxes**: tracks 1-8. Filled = the track just triggered (or a POLY note is held on its voice).
  A small line above a box marks a POLY track.
- **Bottom-left tuner**: note name, octave and cents (A4 = 440 Hz). `--` = no clear pitch or too quiet.
  It hears the main output: solo a track to tune it; a chord shows its common root.
- **Spectrum** (Spectrum build): bars 30 Hz (left) .. 20 kHz (right), about 60 dB tall; dots = falling peaks;
  small ticks under the bars at 100 Hz, 1 kHz, 10 kHz. Bass (< 350 Hz) is finer but reacts more slowly (170 ms window).
- **X-Y**: mono = vertical line, left-only = "\", right-only = "/", out of phase = horizontal, wide = cloud.
- Knobs change the parameters of the selected page while the scope is open (the page is hidden behind the scope;
  close it to read values).

## Digi utilities (elekloader mod `digiutils`, 1.8a and later)
- **Hold "..."** (about half a second) opens the page; a short press is the stock SONG MODE popup, so Song mode
  works as on the official OS (popup, EDIT, double press). Inside the page "..." cycles
  **waveform -> spectrum -> X-Y -> close**; NO closes. The page stays open through pattern / bank changes.

## Mod matrix (elekloader mod `digimatrix`, 1.0a and later)
**SETTINGS > MOD MATRIX** (YES on the row) opens a page of 8 routing slots. Each slot sends one LFO to one
parameter of one track:

```
MOD MATRIX                    DEP OWN
1 T1 L2 > T4 FLT.FREQ          32
2 T3 L1 > T3 AMP.PAN          -18  X
3 - - -
```

| control | what it does |
|---|---|
| UP / DOWN, or the LEVEL knob | choose a slot |
| YES | turn the slot on (it starts on the cursor's own track) or off again |
| NO | leave the page |
| knob A | source track, 1-8 |
| knob B | source LFO, 1 or 2 |
| knob C | destination track, 1-8 |
| knob D | destination parameter |
| knob E | depth, -64 .. +64 (2 a notch) |
| knob F | OWN: whether that LFO still modulates its own track's DEST as well (blank), or only what the matrix routes it to (`X`) |

- Destinations are named by their page: `SRC.A`..`SRC.H` (the track's SRC page, whatever its machine calls
  them), `FLT.TYPE`/`FREQ`/`RESO`/`ENV`/`ATK`/`DEC`/`SUS`/`REL`, `FLT2.A`..`FLT2.E` (the second filter page),
  `AMP.ATK`/`HOLD`/`DEC`/`OVER`/`DEL`/`REV`/`PAN`/`VOL`, and `L1.*` / `L2.*` (an LFO can modulate the other
  one's speed, depth, and so on).
- Each slot has its own depth, so one LFO can move four parameters by four different amounts. The LFO's own
  **DEP** on its LFO page keeps controlling only its own track's modulation.
- The source LFO runs as it always did: its SPD, MULT, WAVE, PHAS, FADE and trig MODE are on its own track's
  LFO page. A trig-mode LFO only moves when its own track trigs.
- The matrix is part of the **pattern's kit**: each pattern has its own, it is saved with the project and it
  survives power-off (since 2.0d). Loading a *sound* onto a track leaves the matrix as it is.
- A slot at depth 0, or one that is off, costs nothing audible: the whole matrix is about 0.4 % of the audio
  time even with all 8 slots on.

## Recording onto a POLY track (Digi Poly 1.0d and later)
With the sequencer recording, notes played into a POLY track - over MIDI on its own channel, or from the
unit's keyboard - are written into the step, not just as a trig: the lowest note goes into **NOT1** and
the next three into **NOT2-NOT4** as their offsets from it, so a chord of up to four notes comes back
from the piano roll. Notes arriving at the same step are gathered into one chord; a step that gets a
single note plays a single note (NOT2-NOT4 are cleared), so what you played is what you hear.

On the POLY track's TRIG page the **LEVEL knob sets the track level**, and the **LEV fader** in the left
column shows it - the same fader as on the audio pages, with the value shown for a moment after a turn.

## Master EQ (elekloader mod `digieq`, 1.0a and later)
A 4-band EQ on the **master mix** - main outputs, headphones and USB audio alike, like the
compressor - as a **master page**: FUNC+LFO steps through
**Compressor (1/4) -> Master EQ (2/4) -> Internal Mixer (3/4) -> External Mixer (4/4)**.
One page, one band per column (bands 1-4 = knobs A/E, B/F, C/G, D/H):

| knob | turn | after a **press** of that knob (press again to go back) |
|---|---|---|
| A-D | band level, -12 .. +12 dB in 0.5 dB steps | band **Q**, 0.3 .. 8 (16 steps) |
| E-H | band frequency, 20 Hz .. 20 kHz (128 steps, about a semitone a notch) | band **type**: HP, LSHF (low shelf), BELL, NTCH (notch), BP (band pass), HSHF (high shelf), LP |

- A knob switched to its second setting shows it inverted; the knob turned last is underlined.
- For BELL and shelves the level is the boost or cut. For HP, LP, BP and NTCH (12 dB/octave, resonance = Q)
  the level is that band's output level, and the band is always on.
- The graph: the EQ's response (0 dB dotted, +-12 dB top/bottom), band points 1-4 (the band last touched filled),
  ticks at 100 Hz, 1 kHz, 10 kHz.
- Defaults: 1 low shelf 78 Hz, 2 bell 398 Hz, 3 bell 2.5 kHz, 4 high shelf 9.9 kHz, all at 0 dB (the EQ is off
  until a band is changed).
- **Each pattern has its own EQ.** The settings live in the pattern's kit, so they are saved and loaded with
  the project and survive a power-off (since 2.0d). Loading a sound onto a track does not change them;
  loading a project brings back each pattern's own EQ at once. A pattern whose kit was made before this
  starts flat.
- **SETTINGS > GLOBAL FX/MIX > MASTER EQ** (with the firmware's own DELAY, REVERB, COMPRESSOR, INTERNAL MIXER
  and EXTERNAL MIXER): **on**, the EQ you can hear overrides every pattern's own - each pattern you reach is
  given these settings, so save the project if you want them kept; **off**, every pattern goes back to its
  own saved EQ.
- The LEVEL knob works as on every page. As on the other master pages, the title bar returns to the pattern name
  after a while.
- A band at 0 dB (bell/shelf) costs nothing; four active bands cost about 5 % of the audio time (see RISKS.md).

## Digi Mono (elekloader mod `digimono`, 0.10; needs digichain, ticked with it)
- **Pick a machine:** FUNC+SRC on an audio track, then scroll past SLICE (and past any other mod's machines):
  MONO SIN, MONO NOISE, MONO SAW, MONO PULSE, MONO ENS, MONO VO. YES to confirm. The track needs no sample.
- **Play it:** from trigs, the track key, the keyboard (FUNC+TRK) or MIDI, like a sample track. The note
  and knob A (TUNE) set the pitch.
- **SRC page:** knob A is TUNE. B to H are the machine's; a knob it does not have is blank. Each shows its
  name, a plain knob and its value in its units (the pop-up gives the long name):

  | machine | B | C | D | E | F | G | H |
  |---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
  | SIN   | - | - | - | - | - | - | - |
  | NOISE | ST (sample and hold rate) | RED (darker) | - | STON (pitched) | - | - | - |
  | SAW   | UNIL (unison level) | UNIW (detune) | - | UNIX (1-3 saws) | SUBX (sub square..saw, %) | SUB1 (-1 oct) | SUB2 (-2 oct) |
  | PULSE | UNIL | UNIW | SUB2 (-2 oct) | SUB1 (-1 oct) | PW (duty %) | PWAD (PWM depth) | PWRS (PWM rate) |
  | ENS   | PCH2 (semitones) | PCH3 | PW (duty %, 0 = square) | PCH4 | WAVE (saw..pulse, %) | CHRL (chorus level) | CHRW (chorus width) |
  | VO    | VOC1 (vowel: OO U AW AH UH AE EH IH EE ER) | VOC2 | VOIC (breath) | V-SW (glide VOC1 -> VOC2; 0 = VOC1 only) | CONS (- S SH F H T K P) | CLEN (ms) | CVOL (consonant level) |

  The volume is the track's: LEVEL, the AMP page and VOL. D does not open the sample list on these machines.

- **Everything else works as usual:** the FLTR, AMP and LFO pages, p-locks, parameter locks on these
  knobs, the sends and the track level.
- **Keep it to a few tracks:** on a unit the stock audio engine already uses about 80 % of each block
  with a song playing (digihealth's measurement), so the room left for added engines is small, and code
  outside the stock render costs more there than its instruction count (the processor's 8 KB code cache).
  As a guide: VO, ENS and PULS cost about as much a voice as SOPHIE, whose author finds one instance
  comfortable and two with FAST AUDIO; SIN, NOIS and SAW at their defaults cost a quarter to a half of
  that. Only sounding voices count (a track sleeps once its amp envelope is silent). When the screen or
  buttons get slow, or you hear clicks, use fewer of them at once, keep digihealth's FAST AUDIO on, and
  check the load with its SYSTEM INFO (DSP, now and peak).

## Song mode
Stand-alone builds (tools/build.py): disabled, pattern chains work as usual.
Digi utilities 1.7a and later (elekloader): Song mode works as stock; the utility page opens on a held "...".
